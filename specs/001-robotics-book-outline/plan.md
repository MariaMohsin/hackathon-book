# Implementation Plan: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

**Branch**: `001-robotics-book-outline` | **Date**: 2025-12-04 | **Spec**: spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-robotics-book-outline/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan outlines the architecture, section structure, research approach, and validation strategy for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book" project. The primary goal is to create a fully structured Docusaurus site, ready for deployment on GitHub Pages, with content suitable for automated generation in subsequent iterations.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown (for content), TypeScript/JavaScript (for Docusaurus configuration)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, Git, GitHub Pages
**Storage**: Git repository for content and configuration files
**Testing**: Content validation (technical accuracy, reproducibility, completeness, clarity, consistency), Docusaurus build validation (no errors, successful deployment)
**Target Platform**: Web (static site generated by Docusaurus, hosted on GitHub Pages)
**Project Type**: Technical Book (Docusaurus site)
**Performance Goals**: Fast loading times for static Docusaurus pages.
**Constraints**: Research-concurrent approach, plan organized into Research, Foundation, Analysis, and Synthesis phases. Adherence to APA citation style for research. No code or deep technical explanations in this iteration. Output must be Docusaurus-ready file/folder structure.
**Scale/Scope**: Initial outline: 4-6 modules, 800-1200 words. Final book: 10-15 chapters + Preface, 12k-20k words.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Accuracy**: All content MUST be verified with official documentation. (Compliant: Plan emphasizes research and validation strategy.)
- **Simple, clear writing**: All content MUST be written at a Grade 8–10 reading level. (Compliant: Plan includes clarity and consistency checks for content validation.)
- **Practical-first**: Every chapter MUST include commands, code, or examples. (Compliant: Plan notes simulations, code examples, and practical exercises.)
- **AI-native**: The book MUST demonstrate how Claude Code + Spec-Kit assist at each step. (Compliant: This planning process itself uses Spec-Kit and Claude Code.)
- **Standards**: Code must run exactly as written. Folder structures must match a real Docusaurus project. Use Spec-Kit workflow. Cite only official docs. Consistent formatting, clean structure, short paragraphs. (Compliant: Plan specifies Docusaurus-ready structure, validation checks for reproducibility and consistency, and APA citation style for official docs.)
- **Workflow Rules**: All commands MUST be validated using Claude Code (CCR). Spec-Kit MUST be used for chapters and tasks. Build MUST be tested locally. No unverified claims or made-up tools. Chapters MUST start with learning objectives. (Compliant: Plan includes testing/validation strategy for content and Docusaurus build, and adheres to Spec-Kit workflow.)

**Structure Decision**: The proposed Docusaurus-specific structure leverages the `docs` folder for all book content, organized into modules (e.g., `ros2`, `gazebo-unity`) with `_category_.json` for sidebar management and individual Markdown files for chapters. Supporting Docusaurus configuration and static assets are placed in `src/`, `static/`, `docusaurus.config.ts`, `sidebars.ts`, and relevant package/typescript configuration files. This structure directly supports Docusaurus's content and navigation system, ensuring readiness for GitHub Pages deployment.
