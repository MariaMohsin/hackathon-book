# Research Plan: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

This document outlines the research strategy and areas of focus for developing the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book." The goal is to gather necessary information, define technical approaches, and identify content sources to support the automated content generation and Docusaurus deployment.

## Module 1: ROS 2
### Research Focus
-   Key primary sources and official documentation for ROS 2, focusing on setup, core concepts, and common robotic applications.
-   Identification of suitable ROS 2 simulations, code examples, or images required to illustrate practical concepts.

### Technical Decisions & Trade-offs
-   Investigation of optional hardware paths (proxy robots, miniature humanoid platforms like Humanoid, or premium lab setups) that are compatible with ROS 2.
-   Analysis of simulation platforms (local RTX workstation vs. cloud instances) for running ROS 2-based robot simulations.
-   Evaluation of trade-offs including cost, accessibility for students/developers, and computational requirements specific to ROS 2 implementation and deployment.

## Module 2: Gazebo & Unity
### Research Focus
-   Key primary sources and official documentation for Gazebo and Unity for robotics simulation, including integration with ROS 2.
-   Identification of relevant simulations, code examples, or images required for Gazebo/Unity-based robotics scenarios.

### Technical Decisions & Trade-offs
-   Investigation of optional hardware paths compatible with Gazebo/Unity simulations.
-   Analysis of simulation platforms (local RTX workstation vs. cloud instances) for optimal performance with Gazebo/Unity.
-   Evaluation of trade-offs: cost, accessibility, computational requirements specific to Gazebo/Unity simulation development.

## Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac
### Research Focus
-   Key primary sources and official documentation for the NVIDIA Isaac platform, focusing on Isaac Sim, Omniverse, and other relevant tools.
-   Identification of simulations, code examples, or images required to demonstrate NVIDIA Isaac capabilities.

### Technical Decisions & Trade-offs
-   Investigation of optional hardware paths compatible with NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem.
-   Analysis of simulation platforms (local RTX workstation vs. cloud instances) for optimal performance and scalability with NVIDIA Isaac.
-   Evaluation of trade-offs: cost, accessibility, computational requirements specific to NVIDIA Isaac development and deployment.

## Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
### Research Focus
-   Key primary sources, peer-reviewed papers, and official documentation for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems in robotics, including large language models (LLMs) and visual perception.
-   Identification of simulations, code examples, or images required to illustrate VLA concepts and applications.

### Technical Decisions & Trade-offs
-   Investigation of optional hardware paths capable of supporting VLA model inference and deployment.
-   Analysis of computational platforms (local RTX workstation vs. cloud instances) for training and deploying VLA models.
-   Evaluation of trade-offs: cost, accessibility, and computational requirements specific to VLA system development.

## General Research Areas
-   Best practices for organizing content for Docusaurus, including folder structure, sidebar organization, and Markdown file conventions.
-   Official documentation and best practices for deploying a Docusaurus site to GitHub Pages.
-   Overall guidelines for maintaining APA citation style throughout the book content.

## Validation & Testing Strategy Research
-   Methods and tools for defining comprehensive content validation checks, ensuring technical accuracy, reproducibility of examples, completeness of topics, and overall clarity and consistency.
-   Strategies for iteratively testing small simulations and code examples before integrating them into full module content, to ensure correctness and stability.
-   Techniques for ensuring all content aligns with the Physical AI learning outcomes and book constitution principles.

## Assumptions
-   APA 7th edition will be used for all citations unless a specific module or source dictates an alternative, which will be explicitly noted.
-   The book will maintain a strong focus on practical, hands-on application and implementation, rather than extensive mathematical derivations or theoretical proofs. This will influence the depth of coverage for certain topics.
